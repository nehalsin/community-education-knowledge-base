# Community Education Knowledge Base

This website covers our tours across the country with schools, communities, groups, farm based familes/communities, _gurukulas_ where we visit as Knowledge Process experts to help hone skills in children, know them deeply, help build them inside out and flower with them together (as in a joint family) while aiding seek own individual aims for holistic success and happiness. 

We go especially to remote _gurukulas_ to interact with children and staff at individual and group level on various topics. 

The Beautiful Mind Mapping, Spirituality in daily life (question/answers), magic of Mathematics, Yoga, traditional seeds' exchange and concrete actions for a better society are our main engagements. 

There are logs with activities achieved and those that are in pipeline. These are updated daily to know progress of the programme helping us give better insights about quality of interaction with each one in the community. 

Our interactions are cordial in nature without any monetary exchanges.
