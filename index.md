# Community Education Knowledge Base

This website covers our tours across the country with schools, communities, groups, farm based familes/communities, _gurukulas_ where we visit as knowledge experts to help hone skills in children, know them deeply, help build them inside out and flower with them together as a joint family while seeking own individual aims for holistic success and happiness. 

There are logs with activities achieved and those that are in pipeline. These are updated daily to know progress of the programme helping us give better insights about quality of interaction with each one in the community.
